## How to Play

1. You need to install an app to play the game. You don’t need the internet while playing, but it helps when using the map.
2. You can start the treasure hunt from anywhere! It doesn’t matter which treasure you look for first.
3. To choose a treasure to search for, tap this button:

5. Treasures are hidden using clues like how many steps away they are (in a straight line) and a compass.  
   The compass shows which direction to go.  
   You’ll have to figure out where north is to follow the compass properly!  
   Make sure your phone’s location (GPS) is turned on.  
   Remember, GPS isn’t always perfect—sometimes it might say the treasure is far even if it's right next to you.
6. Need help?  
   You can hear a hint by tapping:

7. Treasures are shown as QR codes.  
   When you find one, scan it with the app by tapping:  
   ![picture](img/chest.png)  
   You’ll get to watch a cool video and learn something new!
8. Want to take a memory photo during the search?  
   Tap this button:  
   ![picture](img/camera_do_photo.png)  
   The photo will be saved with the treasure you were hunting!
9. After you find a treasure, pick a new one to search for.  
   The app will mark treasures you already found.
10. Share your adventure on Facebook with your photos and stats by tapping:

### Remember

You’re playing outside, and cars will be on the roads...  
Be careful!  
The compass won’t keep you safe—**you must follow traffic rules!**  
Sometimes you’ll find obstacles and won’t be able to walk in a straight line.  
Kids should always play with an adult.

All treasures are in public places, so you don’t need to go anywhere private.

**Have fun with your whole family!**
